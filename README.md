* Name of company: 

JP Morgan - JPM Coin

* When was the company incorporated? 

JP Morgan Chase December 1,2000 - JPM Coin February,2019

* Who are the founders of the company? 	

  * Balthazar P. Melick (Chemical Bank)

  * Aaron Burr (The Manhattan Company)
  * John Thompson(Chase National Bank)
  * JPM Coin has found under the admisnitration of Jamie Dimon(CEO) who previously called Bitcoin a fraud:)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 

> “So anything that currently exists in the world, as that moves onto the blockchain, this would be the payment leg for that transaction,” said Umar Farooq, head of J.P. Morgan’s blockchain projects.

There are many goals of this project; one key goal is to facilitate transactions between consenting individuals who would otherwise have no means to trust one another. This may be due to geographical separation, interfacing difficulty, or perhaps the incompatibility, incompetence, unwillingness, expense, uncertainty, inconvenience or corruption of existing legal systems. By specifying a state-change system through a rich and unambiguous language, and furthermore architecting a system such that wethey can reasonably expect that an agreement will be thus enforced autonomously, they can provide a means to this end.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

JPMorgan Chase invests $11 billion per year on technology.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

JPM Coin is a digital coin designed to make instantaneous payments using blockchain technology. Exchanging value, such as money, between different parties over a blockchain requires a digital currency, so wthey created the JPM Coin.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

JPM Coin is currently a prototype that will be tested with a small number of J.P. Morgan’s institutional clients, with plans to expand the pilot program later this year. JPM Coin is currently designed for business-to-business money movement flows, and because we are still in a testing phase, we don’t have plans to make this available to individuals at this stage. That said, the cost-savings and efficiency benefits would extend to the end customers of our institutional clients.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The commercial entities have started to adopt this blockchain technology in very serious ways and JP Morgan became the first U.S. bank to create and successfully test a digital coin representing a fiat currency. However they do not offer this service to individuals yet. It is only for their institutional clients. Only institutional customers passing J.P. Morgan KYC can transact with these coins. There is any other 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

    * March 2010: First cryptocurrency exchange appeared in the name of bitcoinmarket.com (now defunct).
    * 2011-2013: Bitcoin managed to reach parity with the US Dollar in February. During this year, a few rivaling cryptocurrencies emerged: By May 2013, the cryptocurrency market counted 10 digital assets, including Litecoin. Another major crypto asset joined in August in the name of XRP (Ripple).
    * June 2011: Mt.Gox got hacked for a first time: 2,000 BTC was stolen, having a value at around $30,000 at the time.

    * 2014-2016: Bitcoin price plummeted by 50% and did not recover to its initial price till late 2016. Cryptocurrency exchange hacks have remained ever-present since, though rarely of Mt.Gox’s caliber.

The cryptocurrency market currently hosts over 2000 digital currencies and is still expanding.
